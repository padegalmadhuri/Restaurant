Local usage


After download, use a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer.

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

Navigate to project folder in your terminal.

Check the version of Python you have: python -V.

If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)

For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000
